* An evil emacs

Pretty straight. Works fine. That's all.

# Plan to remove this issue in the future.
/These are the packages installed via nix becasue straight would hang if it did it from straight./

#+begin_src nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  programs.emacs = {
    enable = true;
    package = pkgs.emacs-pgtk;
    extraPackages = epkgs: [ epkgs.vterm  epkgs.org-modern ];
  };

  home.packages = with pkgs; [ nerd-fonts.symbols-only libvterm gcc ];
}
#+end_src

_When trying to install org-modern via straight it tries to pull "org" and emacs st freezes._
